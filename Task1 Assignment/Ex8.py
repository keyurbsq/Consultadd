a = 10
a = "Hello"

"""
As we see above, variable a was assigned int value of 10 but 
on next statement variable a was assigned string value of "Hello". 
Python will allow user to reassign new value that is different data type from previous value.
One of the reason this is allowed is because python is interpreted language and code is executed line by line.
so when it goes to a = 10, the program will have value of 10 in variable a. But as soon as it 
goes in next line and see a = "Hello", it will change the data type and it's value.
