"""
 Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and
 their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
 Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension
"""

students_keys = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan']
subjects_values = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']

#res = {students_keys[i]: subjects_values[i] for i in range(len(students_keys))}

res = dict(zip(students_keys, subjects_values))

print("Students with their respective subjects: " + str(res))
